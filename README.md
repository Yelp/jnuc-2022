# Yelp JNUC 2022 Material

Thanks for attending our talk!

We're excited to share these tools with the MacAdmins community:

- **OktaIDlib**
  - A small library which allows you to query Okta's API in order to retrieve
    additional user attributes
- **Account Demobilization tool**
  - A script which works in conjunction with DEPNotify in order to hand hold
    users through the account demobilization process on bound Macs
